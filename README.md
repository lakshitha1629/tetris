Tetris
======

A small DOM tetris game, tailored to my tastes. Control are the usual:  

* Left/right arrows to move the piece laterally
* Up arrow to make it pivot
* Down arrow to accelerate it (maintain key)
* Space bar for hrd drop
* Esc to pause the game

I just built it for fun, code is neither optimized (take a look at all these globals I use ...) nor beautiful (let's be honnest it's downright ugly). But it does work! There is a weird graphical bug that happens rarely and that I don't have time to correct.
