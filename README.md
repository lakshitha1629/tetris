Tetris
======

A small DOM tetris game, tailored to my tastes. Control are the usual:  

* Left/right arrows to move the piece laterally
* Up arrow to make it pivot
* Down arrow to accelerate it (maintain key)
* Space bar for hrd drop
* Esc to pause the game

I just built it for fun, code is neither optimized nor beautiful. But it does work!
